# Codon Optimization for Biopharming

A set of 
Nicotiana benthamiana

## What Can I Do With This?

The code in this project can be used

1) Creation and omparison of codon usage to existing/standard codon usages.
2) Usage of the script to translate a given protein sequence into correspondign DNA sequence.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites/Dependencies

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Example Usage
